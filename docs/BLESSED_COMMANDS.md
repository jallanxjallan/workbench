# Blessed Commands

A blessed command is a top-level executable in `WorkBench/bin/` that represents a complete user operation.

Current blessed commands:
- `backup-projects`
- `backup-secrets`
- `vault-ingest`
- `create_project`
- `batch-commit`
- `pandoc-apply-template`

Rules:
- If a blessed command exists, you must use it.
- If you typed a pipeline twice, bless it.
