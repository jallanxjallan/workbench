- No introductory or concluding sentences.
- Neutral, professional diction.
- Mid-length sentences (15–20 words) with occasional variation.
- Avoid evaluative or promotional language.

## Examples

**Avoid:**  
> The listing was a landmark moment in national financial history. It proved the institution’s capability and set the stage for future growth.
